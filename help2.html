<p>The Medication Assistant App is a mobile app that keeps track of medication a person is taking, or plans on taking.</p>
<p>The purpose of this mobile app is to help reduce overdoses (ODs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).</p>


<h3>
 How to use the app?
</h3>
<p>
Users have to register an account to save their information. (connect with Facebook or phone number) The app will function by asking user a series of health questions.
After receiving this information, the app will check for potential drug interactions and adverse medical problems that may occur based on the user’s health data while taking their current regimen. The app will also come up with a schedule with which the medication should be taken giving the user reminders when to take medication so they don’t have to remember.
</p>
<h4>
If I do not take daily medication, is this app still useful for me?
</h4>
<p>
Yes.  The app will assist with the administration of medication on an as-needed basis. These users will be also able to input OTC or prescription medication and be alerted to any ADR or OD potential. In lieu of just entering medication into the app, users will also be able to specify an acute issue, such as a headache or fever, and the app will recommend a medication that is safe to take for that issue. Additionally, the app will let them know when it’s okay to take another dose. The re-dose feature and ability to check temporary medication for acute issues will also be available to the daily user.
</p>
<h5>
Can I trust this app? Where is the information about drug come from?
</h5>
<p>
  The drug database comes from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Health (NIH).
</p>
<h6>

</h6>

Users can download information about drug for free. But this app will charged you at an appropriate cost.
