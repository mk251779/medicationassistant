        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
                    <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self' data: gap: https://ssl.gstatic.com 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *">

                            <p>The Medication Assistant App is a mobile app that keeps track of medication a person is taking,
                                or plans on taking.</p>
                            <p>The purpose of this mobile app is to help reduce overdoses (ODs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).</p>


                            <h3>
                                How to use the app?
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                Users have to register an account to save their information. (connect with Facebook or phone number) The app will function
                                by asking user a series of health questions. After receiving this information, the app will
                                check for potential drug interactions and adverse medical problems that may occur based on
                                the user’s health data while taking their current regimen. The app will also come up with
                                a schedule with which the medication should be taken giving the user reminders when to take
                                medication so they don’t have to remember.
                            </p>
                            <h4>
                                If I do not take daily medication, is this app still useful for me?
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                Yes. The app will assist with the administration of medication on an as-needed basis. These users will be also able to input
                                OTC or prescription medication and be alerted to any ADR or OD potential. In lieu of just
                                entering medication into the app, users will also be able to specify an acute issue, such
                                as a headache or fever, and the app will recommend a medication that is safe to take for
                                that issue. Additionally, the app will let them know when it’s okay to take another dose.
                                The re-dose feature and ability to check temporary medication for acute issues will also
                                be available to the daily user.
